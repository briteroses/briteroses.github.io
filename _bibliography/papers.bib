  description={We extend the recent work of Contrast-Consistent Search by Burns et al., 2023, to detect uncertainty in the factual beliefs of language models. We create a toy dataset of timestamped news factoids as a true/false/uncertain classification benchmark for LLMs with a known training cutoff date.}

  description={We introduce weight-space interpolation methods to the adversarial robustness regime, devising a wrapper architecture to optimize the interpolation coefficients of a "model soup" via adversarial training. Varying the intensity of adversarial training (perturbation distance, TRADES weightings, etc.) leads to a smooth tradeoff between the resulting clean and robust accuracy of the interpolated model.}
