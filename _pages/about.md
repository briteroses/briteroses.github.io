I'm a recent graduate from MIT with Bachelor's degrees in Math & CS as well as a Master's in CS. I'm broadly interested in machine learning methods and evaluations that may engender more helpful, equitable, and harm-reducing outcomes for all stakeholders of frontier AI systems.

At MIT, I was fortunate to conduct research on adversarial robustness of deep learning models, advised by [Hadi Salman](https://hadisalman.com/) and [Aleksander MÄ…dry](https://madry.mit.edu/). I was also a teaching assistant for MIT's flagship graduate-level machine learning class (6.867, now [6.7900](https://gradml.mit.edu/)) and for the statistical data analysis class (6.3720/3722). Previously, in the year before entering MIT, I researched black hole formation in general relativity with [Marcus Khuri](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/cards/khurimarcus.html) at Stony Brook University. I've also worked on causal mediation analysis for mechanistic interpretability as a research intern at [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/). I'm currently working on interesting perception problems as a research engineer at [Matic](https://maticrobots.com/), and have been conducting research independently in factuality for LLMs post graduation.
